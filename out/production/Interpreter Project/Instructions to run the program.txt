Instructions on how to run the program:-

(1) We have 4 different input files in the ZIP.

(2) input_file is the deafault file. To select a different input file, 
replace the default file on Line#21 to any of the files in the ZIP (e.g: input_file3)

(3) For input_file2 and input_file4, replace the value to be pushed in the stack to "F" 
as our variable a:=F in the two cases. This is done on Line#421. 
e.g items.push("F"); 

Note: We are using only variable 'a' here. Any other variable is not allowed.
